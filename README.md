You can try the simulation [here](https://hanoi-towers-flask.onrender.com). (Please note it might take time to start up since itâ€™s hosted on a free service.)

This is an educational Tower of Hanoi visualization built with Flask and Python. It uses SVGs to show the rods, base and disks.

# Future endeavors
- Add color customization and ability to drag the disks yourself.
- Fix bug: for n= {14, 15} sometimes the bigger disks might overlap. I need to scale the base and the rod distance depeding on n.
- Improve mobile ui
- Keep zoom and position in page when using slider/ buttons
- Add logger for further understanding! Also maybe include a "debugger" system of the recursive code function hanoi() while the user goes through the steps
